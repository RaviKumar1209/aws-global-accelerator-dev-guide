# Accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator<a name="about-accelerators"></a>

An *accelerator* in AWS Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the availability and performance of your internet applications that have a global audience\. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners\. A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the protocol and port \(or port range\) that you configure\. 

**Important**  
When you create an accelerator, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses\. The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic\. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them\. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators\. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator\. For more information, see [Authentication and Access Control for AWS Global Accelerator](auth-and-access-control.md)\. 

This section explains how to create, edit, or delete an accelerator on the Global Accelerator console\. If you want to use API operations with Global Accelerator, see the [ AWS Global Accelerator API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/Welcome.html)\.

## Creating, Editing, or Deleting an Accelerator<a name="about-accelerators.creating-editing"></a>

This section explains how to work with accelerators on the console\. To work with Global Accelerator programmatically, see the [AWS Global Accelerator API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/Welcome.html)\.

**Important**  
Make sure that youâ€™re in the US West \(Oregon\) Region\. You must be in this Region to create or update accelerators\.

## To create an accelerator

1. Open the Global Accelerator console at [ https://us\-west\-2\.console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us\-west\-2\#Global Accelerator:](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#GlobalAccelerator:)\. 

1. Choose **Create accelerator**\.

1. Provide a name for your accelerator\.

1. Choose **Next** to add listeners, endpoint groups, and endpoints\.

## To edit an accelerator

1. Open the Global Accelerator console at [ https://us\-west\-2\.console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us\-west\-2\#Global Accelerator:](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#GlobalAccelerator:)\. 

1. In the list of accelerators, choose one, and then choose **Edit**\.

1. On the **Edit accelerator** page, make any changes that you like\. For example, you can disable the accelerator so that you can delete it\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

If you created an accelerator as a test or if you're no longer using an accelerator, you can delete it\. On the console, disable the accelerator, and then you can delete it\. You don't have to remove listeners and endpoint groups from the accelerator\.

To delete an accelerator by using an API operation instead of the console, you must first remove all listeners and endpoint groups that are associated with the accelerator, and then disable it\. For more information, see the [DeleteAccelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_DeleteAccelerator.html) operation in the *AWS Global Accelerator API Reference*\.

## To disable an accelerator

1. Open the Global Accelerator console at [ https://us\-west\-2\.console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us\-west\-2\#Global Accelerator:](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#GlobalAccelerator:)\. 

1. In the list, choose an accelerator that you want to disable\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Choose **Disable accelerator**, and then choose **Save**\.

## To delete an accelerator

1. Open the Global Accelerator console at [ https://us\-west\-2\.console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us\-west\-2\#Global Accelerator:](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#GlobalAccelerator:)\. 

1. In the list, choose an accelerator that you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Delete**\.
**Note**  
If you haven't disabled the accelerator, **Delete** is unavailable\.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, choose **Delete**\.
**Important**  
When you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them\.
